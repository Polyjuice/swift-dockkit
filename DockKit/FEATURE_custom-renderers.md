# DockKit custom renderers

The DockKit does not do much rendering. It organizes panels for other systems. However, there is some rendering going on in the Dock Kit as well. For example, the look of tabs and the indicator on what tab is selected. Also for the desktop container, the kit renders thumbnails and indicators on what desktop is active. Also, the DockKit renders rectangles showing where docks will be dropped. All these renderings can be overridden to match the style of the system using DockKit. 

## Example

There is an example here that shows an alternative look for DockKit. It demonstrates custom tabs, custom dock indicators, and custom desktop selections.
